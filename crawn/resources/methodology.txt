		users:

Client side software and libraries:
	Get versions:
		Check out for existing vulnerabilities and CVE's
		
Analyze the client side and server side technologies being used and notice out the vulnerabilities that are going to be tested or concentrated on for that specific js library for both the server end and the client end.

including identifying the database at the backend being used and then focusing on given vulnerabilities forexample if an application is using mongo db then one can the focus on nosql injection and may be grapql injection: something of that kind.	

POSSIBLE VULNS = analysis of the tech stack especially for the side attacks since they are more of being tech specific.
rule out the different vulnerabilities depending on the tech stack.

Get domains and subdomains:

for subdomain in subdomains:
	get all directories: (this is done by crawling and bruteforcing directories to get unknown endpoints)
				using tools like atom , link finder , ffuf, dirb, dirbuseter and so on
		for directory(page) in directories:
			is the root directory and endpoint forexample a login page , something else
			get all endpoints:(these include the previous pages found and also individual functionalities fo	
				found on the page forexample it can a file upload, share functionality etc.
				for endpoint in endpoints:
					Test:
						for POSSIBLE VULNS :
						authentication
							:password guessing 
							:spoofing tokens with a cookie
							:analysing existing defenses like security question , forgot password 
							functionality.
							:lookout policies
						authorization 
							:attacking access to resources like files folders and so on
							:changing the user principle(eg altering from or cooke values)
							:requsting hidden objects
							:attempting caononicalisation attacks
							:escalating priviledges
							:tunneling commands to the sql server
						server testing
						client testing
						session handling
						Functional analysis
							:testing individual functionalities in the application[involves analysing js 
							code and testing out what it does and how it does it
							:breaking such functionalities and combining withe the other vulnerabilities 
							that are present in the web appliction.
						attacking data connectivity
							:attacking the back end database
						attacking management interfaces
						launcking a DOS(unlikely not in a bug bounty hunt)

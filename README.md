# AWE(The AtomWebappEnumeration framework)
Am designing this to aid in my study of webapp penetration testing and the working of webapplications speifically against multple targets
This is not a scanner but it is just convienient for me to use on a target.
## an embedded browser to follow up all the subdomains and urls
## A window to show the network arch of the target(where is the target hosted , which ips , etc)
## A simple text editor to help me make my notes as going on with the webapp enumeration.
## A simple terminal i implemented to run on the line commands, support for working on many targets at the same time} all in one framework.
## i have also developed a custom http(s) proxy to use with the emebedded browser and also any browser of interest.
## Am also adding different parsers for different scanning, enumeration tools that parser the output and show all the relevant information in the dedicated windows.
## i have designed it in linux but am also making it well compatible with windows and active development is still going on 
Generally it helps me get the whole picture of the target(s) esp in the recon phase.

### it is really good for my programming skills and it is helping me understand the working of the web more (esp when i worked on the proxy)
